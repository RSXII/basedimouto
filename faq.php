            <h1>FAQ's</h1>
            <h3>How do I post images?</h3>
            <p>The bottom input on the post box is for images.  To post an image, first either find an image online, or
            upload an image to an image hosting site. (ex. imgur)</p>
            <p>After this is done, ensure that you have the link to the actual image, NOT the page the image is on.</p>
            <p>For imgur this requires you to right click, or long hold on mobile, and open in new tab.  Copy this link
            as it's the image url</p>
            <p>You will know that you have the right url if the image is the ONLY THING ON THE SCREEN.  No menu, no links or
            text.  Just the image.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Google images makes this a little easier as you only need to hold and press copy on mobile.</p>

            <h3>Why is posting images such a pain in the ass?</h3>
            <p>The main reason is storage.  It's expensive to host ton's of images and since this is a free project,
             I simply cannot afford to pay for a lot of hosting.</p>
            <p>Places like imgur however, CAN afford to host images.  It's what they do.</p>

            <h3>Why is there missing features on the site?</h3>
            <p>This site is being worked on by one person currently.  Development takes time with anything and is especially
            a time sink when you don't have tons of years of experience backing you up.</p>
            <p>Features will get added as soon as I can not only implement them, but ensure that they are at least to
            my standard of functionality.</p>

            <h3>Why not get some help to make this faster?</h3>
            <p>If the time comes that I feel like that is needed, I will consider it.</p>

            <h3>How do you not have at least 10 years of experience?  You're older than my dad.</h3>
            <p>I was in the Army for 9 years.  I got a late start.</p>

            <h3>Do I have to be a member to post?</h3>
            <p>Yes.</p>

            <h3>I don't feel comfortable giving you my email address or other personal information</h3>
            <p>Your email is only visible to the administrator and head moderator.</p>
            <p>Your password is not visible to anyone, as it is encrypted upon you creating your account.</p>
            <p>This means that in the event you lost your password, not even we can tell you what it is.  A system
            will be in place to reset your password via the email address you provided in the near future.</p>

            <h3>So you cant just tell me my password?</h3>
            <p>No.  It's encrypted.  I can't even read it.</p>

            <h3>Can I be a moderator?</h3>
            <p>Moderators will be assigned as they are needed and will be chosen by the head moderator.</p>
            <p>The head moderator will choose a user that they see as responsible.  When a moderator is needed,
            an announcement will be made asking for submissions</p>

            <h3>Can I be head moderator?</h3>
            <p>Head moderator will be chosen by the owners of the group the forums belongs to.</p>

            <h3>Can I email you requests to become a moderator?</h3>
            <p>No.</p>

            <h3>Why isn't there "insert feature" on this site?  I've seen it on other sites.  It can't be that hard</h3>
            <p>A lot of sites use pre-built templates or frameworks.  This site has and still is being completely made
            from scratch by me.</p>
            <p>Features will come as I build them.</p>

            <h3>Why not just use a framework like the other guys then?</h3>
            <p>If I wanted to just use 4chan I would go to 4chan.</p>

            <h3>Can I offer suggestions on how to improve the site?</h3>
            <p>Absolutely.  Please send any suggestions you have to xii@basedimouto.com</p>
