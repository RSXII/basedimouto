               <h3>About Ba$ed Imouto</h3>
               <p>Ba$ed Imouto is a facebook group dedicated to humor "providing dank and not so dank memes that we steal from others or create ourself and mark it as OC - original content."</p>
               <p>The group is open to everyone except the easily offended.</p>
               <p>There is also a discord group</p>

               <h3>About XII</h3>
               <p>XII is a web developer out of San Diego, California.  Besides long walks on the beach and extended visits to the local Starbucks for a unicorn frappuccino, he enjoys anime, video games, and being the coolest guy in his circle of friends consisting of only himself.</p>
               <p>If you need to get into contact for XII for any reason, try screaming about how techno all sounds the same and he will promptly find you to defend his terrible taste in music.</p>

               <h3>What is this?</h3>
               <p>This is a project of mine, XII, to practice building databases and back end programming.</p>
               <p>It is a project that has been done for fun and is currently still in progress.</p>
